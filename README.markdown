## Description

This is a library and scripts for accessing a [Symbol
CS1504](http://www.motorola.com/business/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=11607b103d175110VgnVCM1000008406b00aRCRD)
barcode scanner. It also can convert various barcodes to ISBNs for
uploading to LibraryThing. The CS1504 is a consumer handheld memory scanner
that can scan and store barcodes and then download later to a
computer. It speaks a proprietary protocol over serial port (or
USB-to-serial adapter). This library reverse-engineers most of the
protocol.

I use the code for scanning my library since it is easier to take the
scanner to the books. I then download the codes, convert them to ISBN,
and upload to [LibraryThing](http://librarything.com).
