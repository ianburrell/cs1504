This is a library and scripts for accessing a Symbol CS1504 barcode
scanner. It also can convert various barcodes to ISBNs for uploading
to LibraryThing. The CS1504 is a handheld memory scanner that can scan
and store barcodes and then download later to a computer. It speaks a
proprietary protocol over serial port (or USB-to-serial adapter). This
library reverse-engineers most of the protocol.
